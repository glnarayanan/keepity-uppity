## Design Context

### Users
Casual players looking for a quick distraction — a digital desk toy to fidget with during breaks. No onboarding needed, no commitment required. Pick up, tap, zone out.

### Brand Personality
**Retro, nostalgic, cozy.** The feel of a well-loved arcade game crossed with Apple-level craft. Simple mechanics, honest presentation, no gimmicks.

### Aesthetic Direction
- **Visual tone**: Warm and understated. Cream backgrounds, soft contrast, clean type.
- **References**: Flappy Bird's addictive simplicity + Apple's typographic discipline and restraint.
- **Anti-references**: No corporate/enterprise feel, no neon/cyberpunk, no over-designed complexity, no childish/cartoon aesthetics.
- **Theme**: Light only. Warm cream (`#f6f1e7`) base palette.
- **Typography**: Helvetica Neue / system sans-serif. Weights do the work, not decoration.

### Emotional Goals
Calm satisfaction and focused flow. The game should feel meditative — getting into a rhythm of taps, watching the ball arc and spin. Not stressful, not urgent. Quietly rewarding.

### Design Principles
1. **Less is the point.** No menus, no settings, no chrome. The ball and the score are the entire interface.
2. **Warmth over sterility.** Cream over white, subtle shadows over flat shapes, organic physics over robotic precision.
3. **Craft the details.** The ball should feel real. The bounce should feel right. Quality lives in the physics and rendering, not in UI decoration.
4. **Respect the player's time.** Instant start, no loading, no interruptions. The game is always one tap away.
5. **Nostalgia without kitsch.** Retro warmth through restraint, not pixel fonts or chiptune sound effects.

### Accessibility
Standard best practices: reasonable contrast ratios, adequate touch targets, semantic HTML. No specific WCAG target, but don't be sloppy.
