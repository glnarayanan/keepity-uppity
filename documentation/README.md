# Keepy Uppity

A minimalist soccer juggling simulator built in a single HTML file with Canvas and Vanilla JS.

## Project Layout
- `index.html` is the entire game (HTML, CSS, JS).
- `tests/` contains lightweight checks for the game helpers.

## Quick Start
- Open `index.html` directly in a modern browser.
- Click or tap the ball to keep it up.
