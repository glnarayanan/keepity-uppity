- Added subtle kick sound via Web Audio API — warm synthesized "thwap" with slight pitch variation per kick for organic feel.
- Added lower-pitched ground thud on ball drop and graceful game-over transition with 400ms pause before hint text reappears.
- Added progressive background warmth — canvas shifts subtly from cream toward rosier/golden tone as score increases, smoothly lerps back on reset.
- Added idle dust motes — 7 gentle floating particles during idle state that fade out on play and back in on idle.
- Added new high score celebration — subtle two-tone chime mid-game when record is broken, golden particle burst + "New best!" toast when the run ends.
- Summary: Improved the ball rendering with 3D shading, stronger panel definition, and a grounded shadow to better match a classic football appearance.
- Tests: Not run (manual browser run only).
