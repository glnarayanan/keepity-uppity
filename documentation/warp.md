# Warp Log

## 2026-02-08
- Summary: Added the single-file canvas juggling game with a minimalist HUD, high score storage, and click-based physics. Documented the project structure and deployment details, plus a small Jest test scaffold.
- Tests: `npm install --loglevel=error` (no output; appears blocked by network restrictions). Lint/tests not run.
